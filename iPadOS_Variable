#This is specifically for use with a grafana variable named schoolname
#The variable in my case is used as a dropdown and made using the query below from the jamf mysql database.  It only needs to be added once and can be used across by any charts/tables on the dashboard.

#With the school selected from the dropdown then this query will work to get iPadOS Versions by building_name aka schoolname.
#If you want to make a building specific dashboard just replace $schoolname with the exact building_name from your data.
